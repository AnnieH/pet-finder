Pet Finder Project
==========

Part of [ATX Hack for Change 2014](http://atxhackforchange.org/)


**Problem:** Currently, real-time online information on lost / found pets is difficult to find and use, prolonging pet and owner separation and taking up valuable shelter space in Austin, a no-kill city.

**Project:** Create a tool that periodically scrapes pet recovery postings and saves them to a database that can be searched via a web tool and will push notifications to interested parties.
